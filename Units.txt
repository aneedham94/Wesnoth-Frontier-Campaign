These will get converted into unit cfg files eventually, I'm just writing ideas down here.

Militia{
	Level: 0
	HP: 19
	Moves: 5
	Cost: 8
	Alignment: Lawful
	XP: 16
	Attacks{
		Spear{
			Type: Pierce
			Strikes: 6-2
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		None (unless I can define a custom camaraderie ability, then maybe that)
	}
	Description: "In times of conflict, the young men of any frontier settlement can be drafted as an informal militia to defend their homes, arming themselves with wooden spears and a mix of cloth and leather armors.
					Though they lack formal military training, frontier life makes them tough and a fire-hardened spear tip can still pierce the heart of a bandit or orc raider."
}
Town Watch{
	Level: 1
	HP: 35
	Moves: 5
	Cost: 14
	Alignment: Lawful
	XP: 29
	Attacks{
		Spear{
			Type: Pierce
			Strikes: 8-3
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		(camaraderie, if I can define it, otherwise just buff the stats a little bit)
	}
	Description: "In places on the frontier where the threat of attack is more common, forces for the defense of a settlement will tend to organize themselves beyond patchwork militias to improve their fighting capabilities.
					Time spent practicing combat techniques with their fellows both helps them hone their strength and agility and teaches them to work in unison.  Combat drills and patrols around the walls or palisades of their
					settlements increase familiarity with fighting from a defensive position.  And better equipment in the form of metal-tipped spears and tower shields made from wood, hide, and horn increase their combat effectiveness
					over less well-prepared militia forces."
}
Town Guard{
	Level: 2
	HP: 55
	Moves: 5
	Cost: 23
	Alignment: Lawful
	XP: NA
	Attacks{
		Spear{
			Type: Pierce
			Strikes: 11-3
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
		Shield{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 15-1
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		(camaraderie, same as above)
	}
	Description: "The oldest and most experienced members of the town watch are the Town Guard.  Experienced in the defense of their homes and as well-trained in defensive combat as men living on the edge of human civilization can be,
					they also boast heavier armor and stronger shields than their younger counterparts.  Close bonds between guardsmen ensure that they can trust the skill of the men they stand beside and effectively fight as a single unit."
}
Guard Captain{
	Level: 2
	HP: 60
	Moves: 5
	Cost: 28
	Alignment: Lawful
	XP: NA
	Attacks{
		Spear{
			Type: Pierce
			Strikes: 10-3
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
		Sword{
			Type: Blade
			Strikes: 6-4
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
		Bow{
			Type: Pierce
			Strikes: 5-2
			Range: Ranged
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		Inspire
		(camaraderie, same as above)
	}
	Description: "Any guard force will usually choose as its leadership those who are well-liked by all the men they fight with and who show a particular knack for strategy and tactics.  These Guard Captains are
					afforded the best equipment among their peers, often including the use of a sword-a rare thing on the frontier where skilled weaponsmiths are few and far between.  They eschew the defensive shields of their
					peers in exchange for a more versatile fighting style which generally includes the use of a bow, and can be counted on to rally a faltering line or lead a charge to rout the enemy."
}
Runner{
	Level: 0
	HP: 15
	Moves: 7
	Cost: 11
	Alignment: Neutral
	XP: 10
	Attacks{
		Stone{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 5-2
			Range: Ranged
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		None
	}
	Description: "In times of peace, the youth of a frontier settlement can be found running foot races, pelting woodland creatures with small stones, and clambering up trees and rocks, when they are not busy helping their families
					eke out a living on the edge of human lands.  In times of conflict, the skills learned in these activities make them uniquely suited to strategic roles such as messengers and scouts.  Though they have no experience
					fighting, they are faster than most adult humans or orcs and have an easier time moving through rough terrain than larger and more heavily armed and armored enemies would.  If they must engage in combat
					they prefer to do so from a distance, harassing their enemies with thrown stones."
}
Messenger{
	Level: 1
	HP: 28
	Moves: 7
	Cost: 18
	Alignment: Neutral
	XP: 20
	Attacks{
		Staff{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 7-2
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
		Sling{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 5-3
			Range: Ranged
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		None
	}
	Description: "As they gain experience, Runners are often trusted with relaying important messages back and forth across the field of battle or to distant settlements, even through areas where they may find themselves
					caught up in the fray.  To better prepare themselves for this they undergo rudimentary military training with a staff and sling, weapons they already have some familiarity with from play fights and
					other such things youth are fond of.  They are also equipped with some light armor, though not so much that it hinders their movement."
}
Scout{
	Level: 2
	HP: 40
	Moves: 8
	Cost: 25
	Alignment: Neutral
	XP: NA
	Attacks{
		Staff{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 8-3
			Range: Melee
			Special: None
		}
		Sling{
			Type: Impact
			Strikes: 8-3
			Range: Ranged
			Special: None
		}
	}
	Abilities{
		Skirmisher
	}
	Description: "Serving as forward scouts, carriers of critical information, and sometimes even skirmishers before the main line, the quickest and most experienced Runners are invaluable to a settlement during times of
					conflict."
