	description=_"A very well-balanced fighter, Mercenaries can be found employed as auxiliary soldiers throughout Human-controlled lands.  Their versatile fighting style ensures that they can outmaneuver and defeat most foes, though they likely cannot match a master of any of any one particular fighting skill.  They may still consider the village from which they came to be their home, perhaps even supporting a family there with their pay, but they will almost certainly spend a majority of their time away, as necessitated by their profession."
