	description=_"Rangers are Hunters who have taken it upon themselves to watch over and care for the land that supports them.  As they spend more and more time in the wilderness they become much more skilled at moving through rough terrain that would otherwise slow Humans down.  They also come to know the forests quite well, and can mask their footfalls and hide in trees or bushes so that all but those with the keenest senses do not know they are there.  Bandits or others who they feel pose a threat to the lands they guard may suddenly find their packs riddled with arrows and nothing but the creatures of the forest in sight."
