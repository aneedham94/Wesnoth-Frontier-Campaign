	description=_"In times of conflict, the young men of any frontier settlement can be drafted as an informal militia to defend their homes, arming themselves with wooden spears and a mix of cloth and leather armors.  Though they lack formal military training, frontier life makes them tough and a fire-hardened spear tip can still pierce the heart of a bandit or Orc raider."
