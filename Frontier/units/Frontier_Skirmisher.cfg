	description=_"Occasionally, a Hunter will come to find life on the frontier too quiet or dreary, and decide to try their hand at adventuring or mercenary work.  Without setting aside their skill with the bow, they practice close-quarters combat with a variety of weapons, from swords and axes to clubs and spears.  Setting off from their homes, they usually end up in the employ of nobles or the royal army, or rarely gangs of bandits, as skirmishing units, firing rapid volleys of arrows at advancing enemies, or weaving their way through the front lines of combat, picking off solitary enemies.  Though their shortbows are not as powerful as those of the longbow regiments, they are able to fire them faster and in tighter spaces, which suits them far better for the battles they fight."
