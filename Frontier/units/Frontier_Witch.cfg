	description=_"Some Shamans, as they progress down the paths of magical practice, find more value in hexes and blasts of fire than in soothing spells.  Branded as witches and harbingers of evil, they are often exiled from their villages for fear of what harm they might cause if left to their own devices.  In villages where they are permitted, the inhabitants watch them warily and generally only interact when they must out of necessity.  Although they are reviled in most places, none can deny their effectiveness on the battlefield as they leave only charred corpses or helpless wretches, writhing in pain, where their enemies once stood."
