	description=_"Serving as forward scouts, carriers of critical information, and sometimes even skirmishers before the main line, the quickest and most experienced Runners are invaluable to a settlement during times of conflict.  They are equally adept at engaging in close combat with their staves and harrassing enemies from a range with slings, and their agility and speed allow them to dance circles around less nimble enemies.  The fastest among them, when sprinting, can even keep pace with mounted soldiers."
