	description=_"Sages are the greatest healers living in the camps and villages that make up the edge of Human lands.  Years of experience have taught them much of what can be learned about the healing arts, and as such their skill at mending wounds and curing diseases and toxins is on par with that of the healers from formal magic academies.  Though they focus mostly on healing magic, their skills in combat are also impressive as their time spent in the wilds has given them something akin to the nature-controlling magic of the Elves."
