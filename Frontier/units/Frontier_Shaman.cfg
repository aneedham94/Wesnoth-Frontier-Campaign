	description=_"Older and more experienced Herbalists serve their villages as healers, oracles, and mages.  Their control over magic, which is otherwise almost nonexistant on the frontier, commands a great deal of respect from their fellow villagers, and sometimes fear from those who are less knowledgeable.  Increased healing prowess allows them to treat even the foulest toxins and a better understanding of offensive magic allows them to cast fireballs instead of relying on infused bombs."
