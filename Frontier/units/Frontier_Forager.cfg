	description=_"In frontier settlements where men do most of the hunting, woodcutting, and other excessively physically demanding tasks, other activities including crafts, farming, and foraging are left to the women.  It is the task of the Foragers to understand and make use of herbs, roots, nuts, and fruits that grow in the surrounding areas.  In addition to being an important and reliable source of food (as hunts are energy- and time-consuming and not always successful) they are also the closest thing many settlements will have to a doctor.  Although their limited arsenal of tools and lack of formal training are a poor substitute for an experienced physician, there are few who would say they prefer an open wound to one dressed with an herbal poultice."
