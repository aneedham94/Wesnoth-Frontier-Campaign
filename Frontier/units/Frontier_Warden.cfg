	description=_"Having spent a lifetime in the wild places of the world, Wardens are fully at home in almost any type of terrain.  Masters at living off the land, they do occasionally visit nearby villages to restock on more civilized supplies such as metal tools, or if they feel the need for the company that is largely absent in the wilds.  They are equally skilled with a sword or a bow, and their familiarity with a wide variety of terrain allows them to outpace and outmaneuver their fellow humans in many circumstances.  Their close relationship with the natural world has also given them a rudimentary control over nature magic, similar to that of the Elves, and they are capable of calling the forests to hinder their enemies."
