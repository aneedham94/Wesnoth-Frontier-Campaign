	description=_"In times of peace, the youth of a frontier settlement can be found running foot races, pelting woodland creatures with small stones, and clambering up trees and rocks, when they are not busy helping their families eke out a living on the edge of Human lands.  In times of conflict, the skills learned in these activities make them uniquely suited to strategic roles such as messengers and scouts.  Though they have no experience fighting, they are faster than most adult Humans or Orcs and have an easier time moving through rough terrain than larger and more heavily armed and armored enemies would.  If they must engage in combat they prefer to do so from a distance, harassing their enemies with thrown stones."
