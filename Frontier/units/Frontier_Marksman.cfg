	description=_"Marksmen have dedicated considerable time to their skill with a bow, something which proves invaluable for hunting game of any kind.  Rarely do they miss a target, even one running through trees and brush, and their longbows are capable of delivering considerable force to an arrow.  This combination translates quite well to the battlefield, allowing them to match the prowess of the archers of most races, except for the Elves."
