	description=_"The oldest and most experienced members of the Town Watch are the Town Guard.  Experienced in the defense of their homes and as well-trained in defensive combat as men living on the edge of Human civilization can be, they also boast heavier armor and stronger shields than their younger counterparts.  Close bonds between guardsmen ensure that they can trust the skill of the men they stand beside and effectively fight as a single unit."
