	description=_"After many long years of training and experience, those given the title of Hawkeye have nearly mastered the art of archery.  Their skill is close to that of the greatest Human archers, although still lacks in comparison to the Elves.  They can easily and reliably put arrows on a target several hundred feet away, even while they or their target are moving.  If given enough time to concentrate before a shot is fired, a Hawkeye could land an arrow dead center in an animal's heart or in the gap between two plates of armor on a charging horseman.  Though such an attack is time consuming, it is enough to fatally wound, if not kill outright, many opponents."
