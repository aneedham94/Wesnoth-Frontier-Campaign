	description=_"Woodsmen make up the bulk of the population of most settlements scattered around the edges of Human lands.  They are fairly well-versed in eking out a living from hunting game through forests and hills and trading pelts or lumber to caravans passing through the area, and their lifestyle naturally lends itself to proficiency with a bow.  They carry a small dagger for use in skinning animals, though in a pinch they can use it to defend themselves as well."
