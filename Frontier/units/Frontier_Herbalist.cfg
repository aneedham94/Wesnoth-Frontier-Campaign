	description=_"Herbalists specialize in creating brews, salves, pills, and other varied medicines invaluable for those injured in the course of daily life or on the battlefield.  Though they may not realize it initially, practice making medicines and the study of herbal healing agents usually leads to the discovery of some of the most basic elements of magical practices.  This manifests itself as weaponized herbal concoctions, often in the form of a sack or clay container filled with resins and herbs and infused with faint magical energies: a far cry from the elegant sorceries of court mages but effective nonetheless."
