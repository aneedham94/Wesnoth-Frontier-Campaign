	description=_"Any guard force will usually choose as its leadership those who are well-liked by all the men they fight with and who show a particular knack for strategy and tactics.  These Guard Captains are afforded the best equipment among their peers, often including the use of a sword-a rare thing on the frontier where skilled weaponsmiths are few and far between.  They eschew the defensive shields of their peers in exchange for a more versatile fighting style which generally includes the use of a bow, and can be counted on to rally a faltering line or lead a charge to rout the enemy."
