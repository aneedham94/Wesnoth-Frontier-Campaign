	description=_"As they gain experience, Runners are often trusted with relaying important messages back and forth across the field of battle or to distant settlements, even through areas where they may find themselvescaught up in the fray.  To better prepare themselves for this they undergo rudimentary military training with a staff and sling, weapons they already have some familiarity with from play fights and other such things youth are fond of.  They are also equipped with some light armor, though not so much that it hinders their movement."
