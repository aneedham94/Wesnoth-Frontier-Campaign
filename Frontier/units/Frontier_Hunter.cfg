	description=_"Hunters have trained with a bow long enough that they can be counted on by their villages to take down the larger game that forms the core of food stockpiles for winter and other times when food is lacking.  Adept at moving through the woods and hills in search or pursuit of animals, they are more at home in the wilderness than most other Humans.  They may be less well-equipped to fight in a battle than the archers in the armies of the crown, but their familiarity with the terrain combined with their constantly practiced archery skills still make them a dangerous foe."
