	description=_"In places on the frontier where the threat of attack is more common, forces for the defense of a settlement will tend to organize themselves beyond patchwork militias to improve their fighting capabilities.  Time spent practicing combat techniques with their fellows both helps them hone their strength and agility and teaches them to work in unison.  Combat drills and patrols around the walls or palisades of their settlements increase familiarity with fighting from a defensive position.  And better equipment in the form of metal-tipped spears and tower shields made from wood, hide, and horn increase their combat effectiveness over less well-prepared militia forces."
