Version 0.0.1 (This version comprises the first several commits I made to my Git repository, which were mostly done before the creation of this changelog.)
	Created _main.cfg
	Wrote down general info on all Frontier units in a text file
	Created unit .cfg files for the Militia unit tree, the Woodsman, Hunter, Forager, and Herbalist
	Created a .cfg file and map for the first scenario.
	Added the first scenario to _main.cfg
	Wrote down a high-level overview of the plot of the campaign in a text file
	Set placeholder images for the Militia unit tree, the Woodsman, Hunter, Forager, and Herbalist (shamelessly using mainline faction unit sprites)

Version 0.0.2
	Added the team color macro to all existing units so they are no longer always colored magenta
	Defined custom abilities in _main.cfg:
		inspires: all adjacent units on the same team gain +10% damage
		camaraderie: units with this ability gain +10% damage and +10% resistance to blade, impact, pierce damage when next to another unit with this ability
	Defined custom weapon special deadeye in _main.cfg: weapons with this special always have at least an 80% chance to hit
	Added camaraderie ability to Town Watch, Town Guard, Guard Captain units
	Added inspires ability to Guard Captain
	Named scenario 1: 01_Frontier_Peace_Disturbed
	Completed events and dialog for 01_Frontier_Peace_Disturbed
